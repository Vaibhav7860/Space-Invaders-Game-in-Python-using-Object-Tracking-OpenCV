# Space-Invaders-Game-in-Python-using-Object-Tracking-OpenCV
This is the Space Invaders Game created by me in Python using turtle module, OpenCV Object-Tracking and PyAutoGUI.

TURTLE MODULE :.

All the functionality of the game is added using Turtle Module.

Turtle Key Bindings :-

1) LEFT ARROW KEY --------->  For left movement of spacebar
2) RIGHT ARROW KEY -------->  For right movement of spacebar
3) SPACE BAR KEY ----------> For firing
4) A KEY -----------------> For firing
5) S KEY -----------------> For Starting the game

SOUND MODULES :-

1) Winsound :- This module is used for addding collision sound, firing sound and game over sound.
2) Playsound :- This module is used for adding background music to the game.

OPENCV OBJECT DETECTION AND TRACKING :-

Object Used :- Highlighter

We are detecting the green color of the cap of the highlighter , tracking its motion and finding the direction of its motion.

1) LEFT ARROW KEY ---------> WEST
2) RIGHT ARROW KEY -------->  EAST
3) SPACE BAR KEY ----------> NORTH
4) A KEY -----------------> SOUTH

PyAutoGUI MODULE :-

We are making the respective key presses using PyAutoGUI Module when different directions are detected.

1) NORTH --------------->  SPACE BAR KEY PRESSED
2) SOUTH ----------------> A KEY PRESSED
3) EAST ----------------> RIGHT ARROW KEY PRESSED
4) WEST ----------------> LEFT ARROW KEY PRESSED

I am open to any type of improvements which you can suggest. So, don't hesitate in making your contributions in this project as pull request is open for all.
